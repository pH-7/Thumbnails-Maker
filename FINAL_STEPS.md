# Final Steps for App Store Submission

We've prepared your YouTube Thumbnail Creator app for App Store submission and added a new YouTube optimization feature. Here's a summary of what we've done and the final steps to complete the submission process.

## What We've Added

1. **YouTube Thumbnail Optimization**
   - Added a new optimization feature specifically for YouTube thumbnails
   - Uses WebP format for better quality-to-size ratio (25-35% smaller files)
   - Maintains the recommended 1280x720 resolution
   - Added a toggle in the UI for users to enable this optimization

2. **App Store Submission Tools**
   - Created a submission script (`scripts/app-store-submit.js`)
   - Added a new npm script (`npm run submit-appstore`)
   - Created a comprehensive guide (`APP_STORE_SUBMISSION.md`)

## Final Steps for App Store Submission

1. **Get a Distribution Provisioning Profile**
   - Log in to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list)
   - Create a Mac App Store distribution provisioning profile for your app ID (`ph7.me.youtube-thumbnail-combiner`)
   - Download and save it as `build/embedded.provisionprofile` in your project

2. **Store App-Specific Password in Keychain**
   ```bash
   xcrun altool --store-password-in-keychain-item AC_PASSWORD -u "your_apple_id@example.com" -p "your-app-specific-password"
   ```

3. **Build and Submit**
   ```bash
   npm run submit-appstore
   ```

4. **Complete App Store Connect Information**
   - Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/6743055043/distribution/macos/version/inflight)
   - Complete all required information:
     - App description
     - Screenshots (make sure to include the new YouTube optimization feature)
     - Privacy policy
     - Age rating
     - Pricing and availability

5. **Submit for Review**
   - Once all information is complete, click "Submit for Review"

## Testing the New YouTube Optimization Feature

Before submitting, you might want to test the new YouTube optimization feature:

1. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Create a thumbnail with the "YouTube Optimization" toggle enabled
3. Check the optimized WebP file in your Pictures/YouTube-Thumbnails folder
4. Verify the file size reduction and quality

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during submission:

1. Check the error messages in the terminal
2. Verify your provisioning profile is correctly placed at `build/embedded.provisionprofile`
3. Make sure your Apple Developer Program enrollment is active
4. Ensure your app-specific password is correctly stored in the keychain
